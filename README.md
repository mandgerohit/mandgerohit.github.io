Hi, welcome to the GitHub source code for my portfolio.
I created this portfolio on January 1st, 2014 as a promise to myself
to become a better programmer and to become an active member on GitHub.
I've come a long way since then, and I know I have a long way to go!

My portfolio contains a two year snapshot (Jan 2013 to Jan 2015)
of the projects that I've created from scratch. During that time,
I've had the opportunity with work with many really cool people!
